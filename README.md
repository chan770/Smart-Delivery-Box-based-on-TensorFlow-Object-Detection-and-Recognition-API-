# Smart-Delivery-Box-based-on-TensorFlow-Object-Detection-and-Recognition-API-
 The Object Detection Smart Delivery box uses Raspberry Pi and TensorFlow object detection API. It captures the delivery person's picture, allowing remote access via an Android app. Inside, it scans and identifies packages, emailing pictures to the user. The receiver module displays package names and provides voice control via Google Assistant.

The Object Detection Smart Delivery Box is a technological solution aimed at revolutionizing the delivery process for online shopping packages. With the exponential growth of e-commerce, there is a need for smarter technologies to ensure trouble-free delivery experiences for users. This system utilizes object detection and recognition techniques to enhance the efficiency and security of package deliveries.

The system architecture consists of several components working in harmony to achieve seamless package delivery. It starts with a camera mounted on the delivery box, which captures an image of the delivery person. This image is then sent to the user's phone via email, providing an extra layer of security and verification. The user can remotely open the delivery box using an Android application.

Inside the delivery box, another camera, typically a Raspberry Pi camera, scans the package and employs the TensorFlow Object Detection API to recognize the contents of the package. The system uses specific deep learning models, such as the ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco architecture, to train neural networks for object detection.

The package recognition process is automated through a Python script. When a package is placed inside the box, the script captures an image of the package and sends it to the TensorFlow API for recognition. If the package is recognized, an email is sent to the user, containing the name of the package.

The system also includes a receiver module with an Arduino UNO microcontroller, an XBEE receiver module for data transmission, a speaker for audio notifications, and a 16X2 LCD display for displaying package details. This module ensures seamless communication between the delivery box and the user.

The Android application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. It includes functionalities such as user login, remote door opening/closing, and status display. The application communicates with a Firebase authenticator for user authentication and integrates with the Firebase relational database to update the current status of the delivery box.

The Object Detection Smart Delivery Box offers several advantages. It eliminates the need for users to be present at home for successful deliveries, making it convenient and flexible. The system ensures the safety and security of packages, reducing the risk of theft or wrong deliveries. Additionally, the use of object detection technology enhances efficiency and accuracy in recognizing package contents.

In terms of future scope, the system could be further enhanced by incorporating features such as UV light sanitation for packages, ensuring hygiene and preventing the spread of infections. Voice interaction capabilities could also be integrated, enabling users to communicate with the delivery person remotely.

Overall, the Object Detection Smart Delivery Box is a promising solution that addresses the challenges of package deliveries in the e-commerce industry. By leveraging object detection and recognition technologies, it provides a contactless and automated delivery experience, enhancing user convenience and package security.
